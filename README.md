Teaching code.

1.) The set of python scripts with the title "Fluids" simulate the properties of a simple fluid using the Florey-Huggins free energy.
2.) "rocket_multibody.py" is a python script that simulate the physics of massive bodies interacting with an inverse square force. 
3.) "rocket.cpp" and the associated header file is a C++ version of the "rocket_multibody.py" script. I compiled the code on my machine using g++
with the c++14 standard
