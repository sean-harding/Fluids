1.) The set of python scripts with the title "Fluids" simulate the properties of a simple fluid using the Florey-Huggins free energy.
2.) "rocket_orbit.py" and "rocket_multibody.py" are python scripts that simulate the physics of massive bodies interacting with an inverse square force. The former is set up for a simple two-body problem, while the latter generalizes this approach to allow for more than two bodies in the simulation.
3.) "rocket.cpp" and the associated header file is a C++ version of the "rocket_multibody.py" script.
